## About this site

_Practical JavaScript_ is the original work of me, [Andrew Hedges](http://andrew.hedges.name), a 
professional web developer since 1998. I wrote _Practical JavaScript_ because there seems to be a 
dearth of introductions to the language that don't call you names like "dummy" or "idiot" if you don't 
already know how to program. JavaScript programming is fun. I hope this site helps others discover its 
joys!

## Desktop software

* [Coda](http://www.panic.com/coda/)
* [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/)

## Server software

PracticalJavaScript.com is hosted on [pair Networks](http://pair.com/) using a slightly hacked version of 
[EpiCode](http://github.com/jmathai/epicode) serving flat files parsed by 
[SmartyPants](http://michelf.com/projects/php-smartypants/) and a slightly hacked version of 
[Markdown](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/). You can view the raw Markdown for any
page by injecting `/pages` into its URL. E.g., for this page you can see the raw version at 
<http://practicaljavascript.com/pages/colophon>

Stats are tracked using [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/).

## Web standards

This site is built with [HTML5](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html) and 
[CSS3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-roadmap/). No apologies. It 
[validates](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fpracticaljavascript.com%2F;ss=1;verbose=1), 
and if it doesn't, I want to hear about it. If it doesn't look good in your browser, consider upgrading your 
browser. If you're using the latest and greatest and it still has issues, please let me know. Most importantly, 
the content should be accessible across every imaginable user agent.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to the inestimable [Remy Sharp](http://remysharp.com/) for giving us the super useful 
[jsconsole.com](http://jsconsole.com/), without which this tutorial would have been far more wordy and 
complicated.

You're more than welcome to suggest changes. The most effective way to do this is to edit the files I 
use to serve this site and send them to me. Just insert `/pages` into the URL of any page on the site, 
save the result locally and make your changes. Send them to me and I'll compare them with what's live 
on the site and decide whether to incorporate your changes. Any changes will be acknowledged on this 
page.
