> A "development environment" is what programmers call the software you need to write and execute 
computer programs. Ohhh yeah, you're a programmer now.

One of the best things about writing JavaScript is how simple the development environment can be. 
All you really need is a web browser and a text editor. There are a couple of other things we'll set 
up that give us some advanced capabilities, but at its simplest, that's it.

## JavaScript console

You can use this online [JavaScript console](http://jsconsole.com/) to try out any 1-line programs. It 
runs in a web browser. It's super handy. So, if you haven't already, open it up in another window or 
tab now.

## Text editor

This step is dead simple. You need an app that can edit text. Not to give away any trade secrets 
or anything, but programmers call these "text editors." I know, right?

Just to be clear as crystal, Microsoft Word is not a text editor. It's a word processor. What's the 
difference? Word (and other word processors, such as Apple's Pages) save files in formats that include a 
bunch of junk other than just the text (where, by "junk," I mean super useful formatting information).

I develop in [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/), a web development environment for the Mac that's 
excellent for writing JavaScript. Alas, it's not free, so if you prefer to do this on the cheap, here 
are a couple of alternatives that are. Go get one. Install it. Then continue.

### Skeleton page

OK, you should now have a proper text editor installed. Fire that sucker up and let's create a new 
file. This file will be where we write JavaScript programs longer than a single line. Which will be, 
you know, most of them.

Copy the HTML below and paste it into a blank file in your fancy, new text editor.

<pre class="sh_html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
&lt;html>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Practical JavaScript&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;script type="text/javascript">
    
    // your javascript here!
    
    &lt;/script>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

Save the file somewhere, then open it up in a web browser window. Which web browser? I'm glad you 
asked....

## Web browser

Recent versions of pretty much any web browser are all going to run JavaScript just fine. There are some 
that make it easier than others to do some advanced things like detecting where the bugs are in your 
programs.

Both [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) and [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) have built-in 
developer tools. [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com) also has an excellent developer console, but you have 
to install it as an extension, called [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com).

Here's how to get to the JavaScript console, first in Safari, then in Chrome, and finally in Firefox.

### Safari

In Safari &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced, make sure the "Show Develop menu in menu bar" option is 
checked.

In the Develop menu, select "Show Error Console" (which should really be called "Show JavaScript 
Console").

### Chrome

In the View menu, select "Developer" &gt; "JavaScript Console".

### Firefox + Firebug

With Firebug installed, in the Tools menu, select "Firebug" &gt; "Open Firebug" (you can also choose 
to open Firebug in a new window).

## What now?

You should now have a text editor, a skeleton web page saved to your hard drive somewhere, and a web 
browser with a JavaScript console enabled and ready for fun.

For simple stuff, like 1-line JavaScript statements, you can enter them directly into the console to 
see what happens. For multi-line scripts, the process will consist of the following couple of steps:

1. Open the skeleton page in your text editor.
1. Copy & paste (or, if you remember better by typing, type) the program in the example at-hand into 
   the skeleton page where you currently see the text `// your javascript here!`. (Don't forget to 
   hit "Save"!)
1. Open the skeleton page in your web browser window. In most cases, you'll see an alert message 
   pop up or something. You can also watch the console to see if there are any errors in your program.

Are you ready to (finally) learn some JavaScript? Let's do this thing.
