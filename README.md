Practical JavaScript
===================

Practical JavaScript is...

* ...a gentle introduction to JavaScript.
* ...a work in progress.

I started writing [Practical JavaScript](http://practicaljavascript.com/home) in October 2010. I stopped, like, a month later. Got busy, you know how it is.

I'm posting this to GitHub with the hope that others will find the idea of a "simple as possible, but no simpler" introduction to the language useful enough to contribute to it in some way.

As of today, April 24, 2013, what's here is the raw site. Many of the sites to which I link, the screenshots I use, etc. are out-of-date, it reads as the work of one person, and the content is only about a third of the way written. In other words, there is much work to do to make this a useful, community-driven project!

You can help by [creating new issues](https://github.com/segdeha/practicaljavascript/issues/new) and/or [forking the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and sending pull requests.

Thanks!

Andrew
